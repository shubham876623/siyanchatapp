    "question": "what is fever",
    "answer": "Fever is a medical sign characterized by an elevated body temperature above the normal range, typically as part of the body's immune response to infection or illness. It reflects the body's effort to fight off pathogens by creating a less favorable environment for them. Fever can also be associated with other causes such as inflammation, heat exhaustion, or certain medical conditions.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, fever is usually defined as a body temperature exceeding 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) when measured with a thermometer. It often accompanies symptoms like chills, sweating, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue.\n\nWhile fever itself is a physical sensation that can cause discomfort or concern, understanding it factually\u2014separating feelings of anxiety or fear from actual bodily signs\u2014helps manage the experience better. For example, feeling worried about having a fever is common, but using observation and factual thinking rather than emotional reasoning can help keep perspective and guide appropriate responses, such as monitoring symptoms and seeking medical advice if necessary."
