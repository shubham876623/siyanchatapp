    "question": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a psychotherapeutic\napproach designed ?",
    "answer": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach designed to alter the behaviors and cognitive processes that produce and maintain emotional distress. It actively involves both the patient and therapist in identifying and modifying automatic negative thoughts, cognitive biases (such as overgeneralization or catastrophizing), and maladaptive behaviors that contribute to psychological symptoms. The therapy aims first to help patients step back from and become disjointed from their automatic worries or distressing thoughts (as seen in third-wave CBT approaches like mindfulness), and then to modify the content of these thoughts toward more objective and balanced evaluations of situations. Overall, CBT seeks to reduce emotional distress by restructuring how patients think and behave in response to their experiences."

    "question": "what is soup ?",
    "answer": "Hello SHUBHAM! Based on your request and the context provided, here is a clear explanation:\n\n**What is soup?**\n\nSoup is a liquid food that is typically made by combining ingredients such as vegetables, meat, or grains with water or stock. It is cooked by boiling or simmering and is often served warm. Soup can vary widely in consistency and ingredients, from clear broths to thick, creamy blends.\n\nIn the context of your notes\u2014which discuss emotional processing and problem statements\u2014think of soup metaphorically as a \"blend\" or \"mixture\" of different components. Just like how soup combines diverse ingredients to create a nourishing meal, your emotional experiences can be a complex mixture of feelings and thoughts. Identifying and labeling them (as with Samantha's problem statement) helps clarify what\u2019s going on internally, much like identifying ingredients in a soup recipe.\n\nIf you want, I can also help you work through any emotional challenges or help you create problem statements similar to the examples you shared!"
